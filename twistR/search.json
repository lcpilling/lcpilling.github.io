TWIST framework estimates ‘genetically moderated treatment effect’ (GMTE). akin population attributable fraction (PAF) pharmaco-epidemiology: excess disease outcomes individuals prescribed specific medication attributed genetic variant(s). TWIST extends PAF incorporating information treated untreated individuals. larger set information show four analysis approaches estimating GMTE possible. one relies different set assumptions work correctly provides estimates largely uncorrelated one another. decision framework used decide particular estimation strategy appropriate specific estimators can combined improve efficiency. Triangulation evidence different data sources, inherent biases limitations, becoming well established principle strengthening causal analysis. Hence called framework ‘Triangulation WIthin STudy’ (TWIST) order emphasise analysis spirit also possible within single data set, using causal estimates approximately uncorrelated, reliant different sets assumptions. TWIST therefore robustly estimates many events (outcome can mortality, disease, symptoms, etc) genotype group avoided group experience treatment effect non-carriers.
