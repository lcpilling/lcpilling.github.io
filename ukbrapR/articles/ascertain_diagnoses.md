# Ascertain diagnoses

Diagnosis of conditions in UK Biobank participants come from multiple
data sources:

- Self-report during assessment

- Hospital inpatient records (HES)

- Primary care (GP)

- Cancer registry

- Cause of death

The {ukbrapR} package makes it fast and easy to ascertain diagnoses from
multiple UK Biobank data sources in the DNAnexus Research Analysis
Platform (RAP).

## Requires exported files

This only needs to happen once per project. Running
[`export_tables()`](https://lcpilling.github.io/ukbrapR/reference/export_tables.md)
will submit the necessary `table-exporter` jobs to save the raw medical
records files to the RAP persistent storage for the project. ~10Gb of
text files are created. This will cost ~£0.15 per month to store in the
RAP standard storage.

Once the files are exported (~15mins) these can then be used by the
below functions to extract diagnoses based on codes lists.

## Input

Depending on the data source different coding vocabularies are required:

- `ICD10` (for searching HES diagnoses, cause of death, and cancer
  registry)

- `ICD9` (for searching older HES diagnosis data)

- `Read2` and `CTV3` (for GP clinical events)

- `OPCS3` and `OPCS4` (for HES operations)

- `ukb_cancer` and `ukb_noncancer` (for self-reported illness at UK
  Biobank assessments - all instances will be searched)

Ascertaining diagnoses typically takes two steps:

## 1. Get medical records and self-reported illness data for provided codes

For a given set of diagnostic codes get the participant medical events
and self-reported data. Returns a list of 6 data frames: the subset of
the long clinical files with matched codes.

Codes need to be provided as a data frame with two fields: `vocab_id`
and `code`. Valid code vocabularies are listed above. Other cols (such
as condition and description) are ignored.

``` r
# example diagnostic codes for Chronic Kidney Disease 
codes_df_ckd <- ukbrapR:::codes_df_ckd
head(codes_df_ckd)
#>   condition vocab_id  code
#> 1       ckd    ICD10 N18.3
#> 2       ckd    ICD10 N18.4
#> 3       ckd    ICD10 N18.5
#> 4       ckd    ICD10 N18.6
#> 5       ckd    ICD10 N18.9
#> 6       ckd    ICD10   N19

# get diagnosis data - returns list of data frames (one per source)

nrow(diagnosis_list$hesin_diag)
#> [1] 206390
nrow(diagnosis_list$death_cause)
#> [1] 2650
```

If providing primary care codes for measures (BMI etc) these are also
returned (the `gp_clinical` object in the returned list contains all
cols for matched codes).

## 2. Get date first diagnosed

Usually the user is interested in combining the separate data sources
into a combined phenotype: the date first diagnosed for each participant
from the data/codes in step 1 (cause of death, HES diagnoses, GP
clinical, cancer registry, HES operations, and self-reported illness
fields).

In addition to the “date first” `df` field are:

- a `src` field indicating the source of the date of first diagnosis.
- a `bin` field indicating the cases \[1\] and controls \[0\]. This
  relies on a small number of baseline fields also exported. The `df`
  field for the controls is the date of censoring (currently 30 October
  2022).
- a `bin_prev` field indicating whether the case was before the UK
  Biobank baseline assessment

``` r
# for each participant, get Date First diagnosed with the condition
diagnosis_df <- get_df(diagnosis_list)
#> ℹ ukbrapR v0.3.10
#> ✔ Identified date of first diagnosis in 32162 participants.

You can add a prefix to all the variable names by specifying the
“prefix” option:

``` r
diagnosis_df <- get_df(diagnosis_list, prefix="ckd")
#> ℹ ukbrapR v0.3.10
#> ✔ Identified date of first ckd diagnosis in 32162 participants.

# how many cases ascertained?
table(diagnosis_df$ckd_bin)
#> 
#>      0      1 
#> 470107  32162

# source of earliest diagnosis date
table(diagnosis_df$ckd_src)
#> 
#> death    gp   hes 
#>   451 12396 19315

# date of diagnosis for prevalent cases (i.e., before UK Biobank baseline assessment)
summary(diagnosis_df$ckd_df[ diagnosis_df$ckd_bin_prev == 1 ])
#>         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max. 
#> "1958-01-01" "2006-06-21" "2007-01-12" "2006-06-24" "2007-11-19" "2010-06-16"
```

## Ascertaining multiple conditions at once

The default
[`get_df()`](https://lcpilling.github.io/ukbrapR/reference/get_df.md)
behaviour is to use all available codes. However, the most
time-efficient way to get multiple conditions is to run
[`get_diagnoses()`](https://lcpilling.github.io/ukbrapR/reference/get_diagnoses.md)
once for all codes for the conditions you wish to ascertain, then get
the “date first diagnosed” for each condition separately. In the codes
data frame you just need a field indicating the condition name, that
will become the variable prefixes.

``` r
# combine haemochromatosis and CKD codes together
#   each contain there columns: condition, vocab_id, and code
#   where `condition` is either "hh" or "ckd" and will become the variable prefix
codes_df_combined <- rbind(ukbrapR:::codes_df_hh, ukbrapR:::codes_df_ckd)

# get diagnosis data - returns list of data frames (one per source)
diagnosis_list <- get_diagnoses(codes_df_combined)
#> ℹ ukbrapR v0.3.10
#> → Checking provided codes (remember only the first 5 characters are used)
#>  - N unique ICD10 codes: 8 
#>  - N unique ICD9 codes: 1 
#>  - N unique Read2 codes: 45 
#>  - N unique CTV3 codes: 45 
#>  - N unique UKB-self-reported codes: 1
#> → Ascertaining cause of death data.
#> ✔ Loaded `death_cause` with 2696 matched rows.
#> → Ascertaining HES diagnosis data (ICD10s).
#> ✔ Loaded `hesin_diag` with 239398 matched rows.
#> → Ascertaining HES diagnosis data (ICD9s).
#> ✔ Loaded `hesin_diag` with 0 matched rows.
#> → Ascertaining GP data.
#> ✔ Loaded `gp_clinical` with 30393 matched rows.
#> → Ascertaining self-reported illness data.
#> ✔ Loaded `selfrep_illness` with 185 matched rows.
#> ✔ Finished. Time taken: 59.4s.

# for each participant, get Date First diagnosed with the condition
diagnosis_df <- get_df(diagnosis_list, group_by="condition")
#> ℹ ukbrapR v0.3.10
#> → 2 groups identified - getting date first for each
#> ✔ Identified date of first hh diagnosis in 2015 participants.
#> ✔ Identified date of first ckd diagnosis in 32162 participants.
#> ℹ Finished getting date first diagnosed for each group/condition.

# each condition has full set of output
table(diagnosis_df$hh_bin)
#> 
#>      0      1 
#> 500254   2015

table(diagnosis_df$ckd_bin)
#> 
#>      0      1 
#> 470107  32162
```

In the above example we also included a UK Biobank self-reported illness
code for haemochromatosis, that was also ascertained (the Date First is
run on each condition separately, they do not all need to have the same
data sources).
